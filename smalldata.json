You can play as infantry, using a wide range of infantry weapons, or crew one of the many armored combat vehicles available in the game, from half-tracks to the most famous German and Soviet heavy tanks. Engage the enemy with everything in your arsenal, from your bayonet at close quarters up to the massive 122mm cannon on the Soviet IS-2.

You are coerced into a brutal Hunt to indulge Mr. X's fantasies, under threat of death for not only yourself, but also your family. Your only chance to save yourself and your family is to play the Hunt and win.\r<br>\r<br>Combining stealthy multiplayer action and a needs system, The Ship is a truly unique gaming

Battle through 24 missions spanning 4 interconnected historical campaigns. Take on mission objectives ranging from sabotage and all-out assault to stealth, vehicle combat and rescue. Authentic weapons, locations, vehicles and sounds of war all contribute to the realism, immersing you in the most intense World War II experience yet.\r<br>\r<br>\u00a9 2003 Activision Publishing, Inc.

Factories are being built by NPCs, wars can affect the global economy, NPCs can trade freely and pirates behave far more realistically.<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Technology: Extensive development has gone into the X\u00b3 engine, making full use of DirectX 9 technology, to create dramatic visual effects and stunningly realistic starships.

The homeless, addicted and deranged are rising from the city\u2019s underbelly and committing mindless acts of violence. Could there be an unseen connection between the increasing brutality of the latest serial killings and the increasing crime rate?

The Cossacks II: Battle for Europe add-on continues the renowned Cossacks II:Napoleonic Wars game. It depicts the rather short historic period of the Napoleonic wars. The Napoleon wars changed Europe forever, leading to the formation of empires and putting an end to almost one thousand years of constant strife between small states. The game provides mass-scale battles between thousands-strong armies of the nations involved in conflicts during this period. The theatres of operation introduce France, Britain, Austria, Russia, Prussia, Egypt, and three nations not represented in the original game \u2013 Spain, the Grand Duchy of Warsaw (Poland), and the Confederation of the Rhine.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Cossacks II: Battle for Europe reconstructs in detail the soldiers' uniforms weapons and architecture of each nation. Each nation's army has its unique units and possibilities. The game includes over 180 units 190 buildings and 1200 flora and fauna elements. When developing the combat system the peculiarities of early 19th century warring were taken into account as was the value of formations provisions and troop morale. Tactical tricks utilized by military commanders of the time are fully reflected in the game. An \"honest\" system of bullet and cannonball ballistics based on physics is an innovative addition to the Cossacks engine. Other engine features include 3-dimensional landscaping which creates realistic-looking scenery and towns and impacts combat tactics. For example the firing range of a subdivision of soldiers or a cannon positioned at the top of a hill is greater than the firing range of a unitstationed on flat terrain.</p> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Key

The Cossacks II: Battle for Europe add-on continues the renowned Cossacks II:Napoleonic Wars game. It depicts the rather short historic period of the Napoleonic wars. The Napoleon wars changed Europe forever, leading to the formation of empires and putting an end to almost one thousand years of constant strife between small states. The game provides mass-scale battles between thousands-strong armies of the nations involved in conflicts during this period. The theatres of operation introduce France, Britain, Austria, Russia, Prussia, Egypt, and three nations not represented in the original game \u2013 Spain, the Grand Duchy of Warsaw (Poland), and the Confederation of the Rhine.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Cossacks II: Battle for Europe reconstructs in detail the soldiers' uniforms weapons and architecture of each nation. Each nation's army has its unique units and possibilities. The game includes over 180 units 190 buildings and 1200 flora and fauna elements. When developing the combat system the peculiarities of early 19th century warring were taken into account as was the value of formations provisions and troop morale. Tactical tricks utilized by military commanders of the time are fully reflected in the game. An \"honest\" system of bullet and cannonball ballistics based on physics is an innovative addition to the Cossacks engine. Other engine features include 3-dimensional landscaping which creates realistic-looking scenery and towns and impacts combat tactics. For example the firing range of a subdivision of soldiers or a cannon positioned at the top of a hill is greater than the firing range of a unitstationed on flat terrain.</p> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Key features:</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Control the French, Russians, Austrians, Britons, Prussians, or Egyptians -- master new weapons and tactics during a time that redefined the meaning of modern warfare.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Fight through historically inspired battles of the 19th century, with massive armies colliding in different types of terrain and weather.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Battles on real historical scale with tens of thausands of units on one map.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Realistic Troop Morale System - Well-fed troops live longer and grow in experience to become valuable battlefield assets, while fierce and overwhelming opponents, or marching long distances will cause morale to drop\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Enhanced diplomacy tools help you create treaties that give you the advantages\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>", "price_overview": {"currency": "USD", "discount_percent": 0, "final": 499, "initial": 499}, "background": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/4890/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1447354584", "platforms": {"windows": true, "linux": false, "mac": false}, "recommendations": {"total": 243}, "metacritic": {"score": 69, "url": "http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/cossacks-ii-battle-for-europe?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f"}}}}

Each team, alien and human, has a Commander. The Commander looks down on the battlefield and issues orders, places structures, collects resources, researches technology, and deploys abilities. \r<br>\r<br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/4920/extras/Inline10_StrategyShooter.jpg?t=1479939528\">\r<br>\r<br>Here are some gameplay examples: A human Commander could drop health packs and ammunition to a trapped marine squad, and deploy sentry guns to help them defend their position. Or an alien Commander could grow a new Hive to spread infestation throughout newly captured territory, allowing more alien eggs to spawn...\r<br>\r<br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/4920/extras/Inline11_BattleRoyale.jpg?t=1479939528\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Two Unique Sides</h2>\r\r<br>Aliens players choose to evolve into one of five lifeforms: The fast, fearsome Skulk can run on walls and deliver massive damage with its jaws. Lerks fly and deploy gasses to support their teammates in battle. Gorges heal other lifeforms and build tunnels, hydra turrets, walls, and other tactical structures. Fades blink in and out of battle, picking off marines with giant scythes. Finally, the giant Onos is so massive and so tough, that even entire marine squads can't take it down.\r<br>\r<br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/4920/extras/Inline11_Giblets.jpg?t=1479939528\">\r<br>\r<br>Marines wield rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers, pistols, and other weapons. Cluster grenades can clear ventilation shafts of sneaky Skulks, flamethrowers make short work of alien structures and infestation, and boosts dropped by the Commander increase combat effectiveness. \r<br>\r<br>When attacking on foot doesn't cut it, marines can construct hulking Exosuits wielding miniguns and railguns, and equip jetpacks for high speed assaults on alien Hives.\r<br>\r<br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/4920/extras/Inline5_ExoFiring.jpg?t=1479939528\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Long Term Development</h2>\r\r<br>Natural Selection 2 receives constant updates.

src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/4920/extras/Inline4_OnosMarine.jpg?t=1479939528\">\r<br>\r<br>Natural Selection 2 pits alien against human in an action-packed struggle for survival. Wield devastating weaponry as a Frontiersman marine, or become the xenomorph as a deadly Kharaa lifeform. \r<br>\r<br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/4920/extras/Inline2_FadeMarine.jpg?t=1479939528\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Strategy Meets Shooter</h2>\r\r<br>Natural Selection 2 is a First Person Shooter and Real Time Stategy game rolled into one! Each team, alien and human, has a Commander. The Commander looks down on the battlefield and issues orders, places structures, collects resources, researches technology, and deploys abilities. \r<br>\r<br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/4920/extras/Inline10_StrategyShooter.jpg?t=1479939528\">\r<br>\r<br>Here are some gameplay examples: A human Commander could drop health packs and ammunition to a trapped marine squad, and deploy sentry guns to help them defend their position. Or an alien Commander could grow a new Hive to spread infestation throughout newly captured territory, allowing more alien eggs to spawn...\r<br>\r<br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/4920/extras/Inline11_BattleRoyale.jpg?t=1479939528\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Two Unique Sides</h2>\r\r<br>Aliens players choose to evolve into one of five lifeforms: The fast, fearsome Skulk can run on walls and deliver massive damage with its jaws. Lerks fly and deploy gasses to support their teammates in battle. Gorges heal other lifeforms and build tunnels, hydra turrets, walls, and other tactical structures. Fades blink in and out of battle, picking off marines with giant scythes. Finally, the giant Onos is so massive and so tough, that even entire marine squads can't take it down.\r<br>\r<br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/4920/extras/Inline11_Giblets.jpg?t=1479939528\">\r<br>\r<br>Marines wield rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers, pistols, and other weapons. Cluster grenades can clear ventilation shafts of sneaky Skulks, flamethrowers make short work of alien structures and infestation, and boosts dropped by the Commander increase combat effectiveness. \r<br>\r<br>When attacking on foot doesn't cut it, marines can construct hulking Exosuits wielding miniguns and railguns, and equip jetpacks for high speed assaults on alien Hives.\r<br>\r<br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/4920/extras/Inline5_ExoFiring.jpg?t=1479939528\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Long Term Development</h2>\r\r<br>Natural Selection 2 receives constant updates. This year, 2016, Unknown Worlds continues to develop new features, content, and improvements.\r<br>\r<br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/4920/extras/Inline12_Workshop.jpg?t=1479939528\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mod Tools Come Standard</h2>\r\r<br>Natural Selection 2 comes with all the tools we used to make the game. All game code is open source. That means you can create, and play, an endless variety of mods. Publish, share, and download mods from the Steam Workshop, and automatically download mods when you join modded games.\r<br>\r<br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/4920/extras/SpecialArmor_Small.jpg?t=1479939528\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Digital Deluxe Edition</h2>\r\r<br>Digital Deluxe Edition includes:\r<br>\r<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">\r<li><strong>Official Soundtrack</strong> - 1 hour of tribal, industrial music composed by David John and Simon Chylinski \r<br></li><li><strong>Digital Art Book</strong> - 40+ pages of art by Cory Strader, including environments, creatures, weapons and more\r<br></li><li><strong>Exclusive in-game marine model</strong> - Exclusive in-game marine model - A new marine model with custom visor and armor plating\r<br></li><li><strong>Exclusive Wallpapers and Avatars</strong> - Unique views of the NS2 universe by Amanda Diaz\r</li></ul>", "price_overview": {"currency": "USD", "discount_percent": 0, "final": 999, "initial": 999}, "reviews": "&quot;NS2 is a genius mash of Counter Strike and Starcraft&quot; \r<br> \u2013  <a href=\"http://kotaku.com/5916879/natural-selection-2-is-a-genius-mash-of-counter-strike-and-starcraft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Kotaku</a>\r<br>&quot;This is getting close to my idea of the ultimate game&quot; \r<br> \u2013 <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=b2SglXLMONU/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Machinima</a>", "movies": [{"id": 2029265, "webm": {"max": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029265/movie_max.webm?t=1447358747", "480": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029265/movie480.webm?t=1447358747"}, "name": "Natural Selection 2 Reinforced Trailer", "thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029265/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1447358747", "highlight": true}, {"id": 256661295, "webm": {"max": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256661295/movie_max.webm?t=1456901779", "480": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256661295/movie480.webm?t=1456901779"}, "name": "Natural Selection 2 Introduction", "thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256661295/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1456901779", "highlight": true}, {"id": 2028418, "webm": {"max": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028418/movie_max.webm?t=1462368441", "480": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028418/movie480.webm?t=1462368441"}, "name": "Natural Selection 2 Trailer", "thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028418/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1462368441", "highlight": false}, {"id": 2028069, "webm": {"max": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028069/movie_max.webm?t=1447356962", "480": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028069/movie480.webm?t=1447356962"}, "name": "Natural Selection II - Launch Trailer", "thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028069/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1447356962", "highlight": false}, {"id": 81986, "webm": {"max": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/81986/movie_max.webm?t=1447356552", "480": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/81986/movie480.webm?t=1447356552"}, "name": "Natural Selection 2 Trailer", "thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/81986/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1447356552", "highlight": false}], "platforms": {"windows": true, "linux": true, "mac": false}, "recommendations": {"total": 8217}, "metacritic": {"score": 80, "url": "http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/natural-selection-2?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f"}}}}
